# United Nations Statistics Website

This website is the result of the term project in our Database Systems course. We were asked to design a database solution to a dataset and build a website from our database. Using the 66th edition of the Statistical Yearbook published by the United Nations Statistical Division in 2023, we built a website to showcase and visualize worldwide statistics in 8 different categories, ranging from trading and exchange rates to CO2 emissions and species under threat of extinction.

**Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, MySQL
